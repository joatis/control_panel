The md docs should get updated.
I shouldn't have used so many headers and subheaders especially in the error response section.
Instead of a heading and a block of json of identical fields I should use a table.

Forcing myself to write unit tests for the database and config classes challenged some of my
initial assumptions. For instance, I was going to use a singleton for the configuartion class,
but I realized I was solving that problem at the wrong level. The config should be an object and it
is the apps job to make sure there is only one instance.
The Unit Tests also challenged me to think how these different parts will interact with each other.
